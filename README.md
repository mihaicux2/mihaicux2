# Hi, I'm Mihail 👋 👨‍💻


I'm a software engineer from [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania) with more than 13 years of overall software development experience. I've worked extensively with PHP, but lately all my work is based on NodeJS.

Over the last 6 years, all my projects required NodeJS and were mostly based on cloud infrastructure (AWS and GCP): Lambda Functions, S3 storage, SQS, SNS, etc.

I'm passionate about NodeJS, JAVA and API services, learning Python (especially for its extensive AI/ML data libraries), playing with embedded systems (Arduino, Raspberry PI, ESP8266/ESP32), home automation, Android and 3D printing.

I have good knowledge of algorithms and data structures, I'm passionate about all kinds of code and database optimizations and I really like to tackle difficult projects.

Also, I'm a fast and avid learner, a good team player, intuitive, pragmatic and problem-solving oriented.
